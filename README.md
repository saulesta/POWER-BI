# Welcome to My Power BI Playground!

Hey there, data enthusiasts! Welcome to my little corner of GitHub where I can show off my Power BI wizardry.

## About Me

I'm a budding data wizard who's just kicked off an epic journey into data analytics. Fresh out of Vilnius Coding School, where I immersed myself in all things Power BI, I'm ready to unleash the full power of this amazing tool!

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you'll find a treasure trove of Power BI projects that I've whipped up with love and creativity. From sales dashboards that tell stories to marketing analyses that uncover hidden gems, there's something here to tickle your data fancy. Here's a sneak peek:

### * Adventure Works folder
It's a project I made as a final Power BI project at Vilnius Coding School. I got the data from the teacher, had to make some changes in Power BI Query, later on, made new relationships between the tables, and eventually made a dashboard analysis about sales, sales in particular countries and customers analysis.

### Individual projects:
#### * Nykka file
This png file is a screenshot of my own first dashboard that I made straight out of the courses. It is an analysis about Nykka online beauty store's reviews about brands, and products. Got the data from Kaggle website, where you can get free data for multiple reasons ad one of them is learning.
